# Important Thing


### Client-Side Navigation

1. The [`Link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) component is client-site navigation. mean the page never reload
2. in production build, nextjs detect `Link` component in browser viewport and prefetches the code for the linked page in the background

> example of adding attribute to Link [`click here`](https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/blob/master/snippets/link-classname-example.js)

## Assets

### `Public` folder

1. The `public` directory is also useful for `robots.txt` . Google Site Verification, and any other static assets.

### Metadata

1. If you want to customize the <html> tag, for example to add the lang attribute, you can do so by creating a pages/_document.js

## Pre-render stuff

1. good for seo
2. there are 2 kind of pre-render:
    * [static generation](#static-generation) html and stuff will be render at build time (recommended)
    * server-side rendering: html and stuff will be render on each request

##### static generation

- if the page needs data fetching from an external source i.e API at the build time. there are 4 things to remember.
1. all the bellow function can handle server-side code directly. This includes reading from the filesystem or a database.
2. [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation): lets you pass fetched data to the page's `props`

```js
function Blog({ posts }) {
  // Render posts...
}

// This function gets called at build time
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()

  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },

    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:
    // - When a request comes in
    // - At most once every second
    revalidate: 1 //In seconds
  }
}

export default Blog
```
3. [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation): lets you specify which paths you want to pre-render.

```js
// This function gets called at build time
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()

  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { id: post.id },
  }))

  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.
  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.
  return { paths, fallback: false }
}
```

- if the page needs data fetching on the fly. use this [Fetching data on the client side](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fetching-data-on-the-client-side)

4. [Incremental static generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration)

Incremental Static Regeneration allows you to update existing pages by re-rendering them in the background as traffic comes in.
##### server-side rendering
1. needs to implement [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) which will be called on each request

```js
function Page({ data }) {
  // Render data...
}

// This gets called on every request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from external API
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
  const data = await res.json()

  // Pass data to the page via props
  return { props: { data } }
}

export default Page
```
