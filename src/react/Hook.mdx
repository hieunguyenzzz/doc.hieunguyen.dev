# React

## What is Hook

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Hook is this part `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);` where `count` is consider to be a state of this function component, and `setCount` is a method to update that state

## Why is hook

Before hook coming to the world, the only way to inject new stuff to function component is via `props` and higher order component which require you to restructure your components when you use them
